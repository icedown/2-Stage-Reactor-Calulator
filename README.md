# 2 Stage Reactor Calculator  
This program is for use with the minecraft mod NuclearCraft by tomdodd4598.  It assists with setting up a MSR(Molten Salt Fission Reactor)
You input the data from either the mod or NC Reactor Planner and it will calculate the number of contacts, amount of steam, and power produced by the reactor.


## Getting Started

Put in the reactor heat generation, cooling, efficiency, coolants and number of heaters for each, and finally the type of heat exchanger tubes and it will output the needed information
